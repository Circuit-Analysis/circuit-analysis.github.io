Many areas of engineering have laws or theorems which are "zero sum games".

In circuit analysis, two such laws are Kirchhoff's Current Law and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law.

Before we look at Kirchhoff's laws, we need to define some parts of a circuit.

The first part of a circuit is a node.

A node is an area of constant voltage.  It's usually drawn as a circle, but the node extends to all parts of the circuit connected to the marked circle with a wire only. 

The second part of a circuit is a loop.

A loop is a closed path around the circuit that doesn't cross itself.  A closed path is one that ends where it started.

Now, let's look at Kirchhoff's Current Law or KCL for short.

Kirchhoff's Current Law says that the sum of the currents into a node is zero.

A current flowing out of a node is subtracted.

Another way of stating KCL is that the sum of the currents into a node equals the sum of the currents out of the node.

For this node, we can see that I1 plus I2 plus I3 plus I4 minus I5 equals zero.

Or stated the other way: I1 plus I2 plus I3 plus I4 equals I5.

Let's move on to Kirchhoff's Voltage law.

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law or KVL for short states that the sum of the voltages around a loop in the circuit is zero.
