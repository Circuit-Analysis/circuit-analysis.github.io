    "In the early chapters of this book the calculation of power dissipated or supplied by components was simple enough to be embedded within chapters covering the fundamental calculations of circuit analysis.\n",
    "In the previous chapter we concerned ourselves with the analysis of circuits containing AC sources operating at a single frequency. The result of this analysis led to sinusoidal representations of voltages and currents. In this chapter, we will discover that power dissipation in AC circuits can take many forms. It is critical to understand which form is appropriate for a given application. Therefore power calculations in AC circuits was earned itself a dedicated chapter\n",

    "We are often more concerned with the energy supplied or consumed over a period of time. This would require the integration of the instantaneous power of a period of time which is tedious considering our signals are always sinusoidal in the AC case. To characterize the power consumption of a component we will begin to develop alternate means of describing the power supplied or dissipated in AC circuits.\n",

    "The first means of characterizing power in AC circuits is average power. We must now differentiate between power that is being **dissipated** by a resistor versus power that is being **stored** in a storage element such as a capacitor or inductor. Calculating average power will tell us how much power us being **dissipated** by a circuit.\n",

When there is no difference in the phase angles, the average power is one-half the product of the peak voltages. Any change in the phase shift will decrease the average power.\n",
