    "Both the capacitor and inductor equations result in systems of equations that require knowledge of differential equations. We can approach this type of circuit analysis in two ways: 1) head-on by solving the systems of differential equations or 2) restating the equations using something called a phasor and solving it algebraically. Both approaches are presented here. I encourage you to read both sections if you have studied differential equations. You can skip the next section and proceed the section on phasors if you have not ."
