A scalar locates a point on 1D line and a complex number locates a point on a 2D plane.\n",

The scalar +2 is equal to (2$\\angle$0$^\\circ$) in polar form.  The value before the angle symbol indicates the distance from the origin and the angle indicates the direction away from the positive real axis.  A positive angle is measured in the counter-clockwise direction.  (2$\\angle$0$^\\circ$) is shown on the complex plane below in blue.  -3 can be represented in polar form as (3$\\angle$180$^\\circ$) and is shown in red.\n",
