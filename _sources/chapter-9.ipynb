    "Superposition is the first circuit theorem we will study. It is not an efficient method of circuit analysis but at times it is the only option to analyze a circuit. The examples here could be analyzed as we have in previous chapter and do not require the application of superposition. However, these examples serve as a stepping stone before we consider more complex circuits that do require superposition. Beyond that it is an important theoretical concept for some of the more advanced analysis methods you will learn if you continue your studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The superposition theorem tell us that any voltage or current in a circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages and currents caused by each independent supply by itself. In practice, this means we have to analyze a circuit once for each independent supply in the circuit. The process is detailed below and then applied to a number of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to list the steps here as reference. Use these steps as we walk through the next example.\n",

    "```{admonition} Steps for Superposition\n",
    "1.  Select each independent supply in turn.\n",
    "1.  Replace all other independent sources with their ideal sources.\n",
    "1.  Solve for the desired value using the polarity/direction marked in the original problem.\n",
    "1.  Repeat for each independent source.\n",
    "1.  Algebraically sum the values from each individual supply.\n",
