    "## What is a linear system?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, a linear system is a series of equations. The equations have one or more unknowns (AKA variables). Each unknown probably has a scaling factor (coefficient). And each equation also probably has a constant associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Example\n",
    "For example, the equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:lin1\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\green{x} + \\green{y} + \\green{z} &= \\blue{1}\\\\\n",
    "2\\green{x} + 3\\green{y} + 4\\green{z} &= \\blue{2}\\\\\n",
    "6\\green{x} + 7\\green{y} + 8\\green{z} &= \\blue{3}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "have\n",
    "\n",
    "- three unknowns: $\\green{x}$, $\\green{y}$, and $\\green{z}$,\n",
    "- several constants: $\\blue{1}$, $\\blue{2}$, $\\blue{3}$, and\n",
    "- nine coefficients: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.\n",
    "  - The first equation is really $ 1\\cdot\\green{x} + 1\\cdot\\green{y} +1\\cdot\\green{z} = \\blue{1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are we interested?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear equations like [](eq:lin1) are useful in circuit analysis, because they crop up when applying the Mesh Analysis and Nodal Analysis techniques we will meet shortly in Chapters {ref}`content:chapter:mesh` and {ref}`content:chapter:nodal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many real world problems (outside of circuit analysis) can be solved by applying linear systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "%%%%\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    ":name: ex:lumber1\n",
    "You have 15 feet of lumber, and you are asked to make three shelves using the lumber. If all the shelves are of equal length, what length is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "This word problem can be expressed as the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3 \\green{x} = \\blue{15}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which has the obvious solution\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x= 15 / 3 = 5.$$\n",

    ":name: ex:lumber2\n",
    "Suppose now there are more constraints on the problem of making three shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You still have 15 feet of lumber, and you are still asked to make three shelves using the lumber.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, now we have different constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second shelf must be one foot shorter than the first shelf.\n",
    "- The third shelf must be one foot shorter than three times the length of the first shelf.\n",
    "\n",
    "This word problem now needs to be expressed in several equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\green{x} + \\green{y} + \\green{z} &= \\blue{15}\\\\\n",
    "\\green{y} &= \\green{x} \\blue{- 1}\\\\\n",
    "\\green{z} &= 3\\green{x} \\blue{-1}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is not as easy to solve as the previous one. In the next section, we'll look at how to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solving Linear Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations in the [second lumber example](ex:lumber2) are harder to solve than the single equation in [this example](ex:lumber1). This is because the second example has 3 $\\green{\\rm unknowns}$ or variables. The second example must satisfy all three constraints _simultaneously_. This is the reason that these linear systems are sometimes called _simultaneous equations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} simultaneous equations\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to solve linear systems of simultaneous equations. We will talk about three of them: elimination, substitution, and matrix inverse. The first two can be done using linear algebra and manipulating equations. The third is very useful if you have a calculator capable of doing matrix math.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitution involves manipulating one of the equations so that a single unknown is on the left side of the equation, and all the others are on the right. Then we can replace all instances of this unknown in the remaining equations to reduce their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "%%%%\n",
    "\n",
    "%%%%\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    " :name: ex:subst\n",
    "Let's revisit the equations we had in the [second lumber example](ex:lumber2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\green{x} + \\green{y} + \\green{z} &= \\blue{15}\\\\\n",
    "\\green{y} &= \\green{x} \\blue{- 1}\\\\\n",
    "\\green{z} &= 3\\green{x} \\blue{-1}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "These are already written out in a way that makes substitution easy: the second and third equations already have $\\green{y}$ or $\\green{z}$ on one side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's substitute these two equations into the first one:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\green{x} + \\green{x} \\blue{- 1} + 3\\green{x} \\blue{-1} &= \\blue{15}\\\\\n",
    "(1 + 1 + 3) \\green{x} &= \\blue{15} + \\blue{1} + \\blue{1}\\\\\n",
    "5 \\green{x} &= \\blue{17}\\\\\n",
    "\\green{x} &= \\red{17/5} = \\red{3.4}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have $\\green{x}$, we can substitute its value back into the other two equations to get $\\green{y}$ and $\\green{z}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\green{z} &= 3\\times \\red{3.4} \\blue{-1} = \\red{9.2}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\green{x} + \\green{y} + \\green{z} &= 3.4 + 2.4 + 9.2 = \\blue{15}\\\\\n",

    "### Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Elimination involves adding or subtracting the equations we have so that one or more of the unknowns is eliminated. Once we've eliminated all but one of the unknowns, we can then solve the problem with the remaining single unknown like we did in [this example](ex:lumber1).\n",
